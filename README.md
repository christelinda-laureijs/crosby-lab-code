# Crosby Lab Code

This is a collection of R scripts for analyzing and plotting data from electrophysiology experiments conducted in the Crosby Lab. These data include evoked current amplitudes and action potential properties. I am developing this into a package with full documentation, which will be released soon.

## Evoked currents

The script will generate the following plots:

  - Raw data plotted as evoked current amplitude vs. time for a single recording
  - "Pruned" plots of a single recording featuring the featuring the , as well as "pruned" plots featuring 


These include evoked current amplitudes  and plotting evoked currents and action potentials.
